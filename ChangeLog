[TASK] Add missing language files in fixtures extension

[TASK] TYPO3v6.0 compatibility Part 3
Enable roundtrip/edit mode as it worked before (hopefully)
[TASK] TYPO3v6.0 compatibility Part 2
Now the generated extensions are namespaced! Also a vendor name is added and can be modified in the GUI.
Edit (roundtrip) mode is NOT supported yet. (So there will be a part 3 of compatibility update)
Somehow the generated plugins can create,delete, list and show models, but not update.
I guess that's a extbase bug, since the repository update does not result in updated models.
[TASK] Compatibility with 6.0 Part 1(!)
All tests are green again. Removed all usage of deprecated class names in extension_builder.
This is called part 1 since the generated extensions are not yet namespaced!!
This will happen in part 2. This revision's edit mode should be compatible with 4.7 generated extensions!
The next revision will generate namespaced extensions and the edit mode will be only applicable for
extensions generated with that revision (or later)
Added missing arguments in Tests
[TASK] Minor CGL cleanups
- Uses tabs for indent in flexform XML
- Removes trailing space for storagePid
[BUGFIX] Adds default error styles for textareas, like inputs.
When extension builder generates the typoscript for an extension,
it includes default css that turns input elements red on form
error (class: 'f3-form-error'). This should also apply to textareas
as well. They, too, receive the error class, but the styles have
always been missing.
[BUGFIX] Fix wrong flexform reference
Resolves: #39270
