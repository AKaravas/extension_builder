[TASK] Enable merging of xliff files
This patch enables "merging" of xliff localization files.
Manually added key/label pairs are preserved on rewriting
the files, but changes made in the modeler are applied.
When renaming a model or a property the old id/label is
not removed, since we would have to load all labels from
the previous version of the extension to identify renamed
items.
Support for xml format is dropped.

[TASK] Enable property type specific options

[BUGFIX] Make Extension Builder work with current master
In the current TYPO3 master branch (6.2) all modules
require a module token to avoid CSRF attacks.
Because of that, we need to change the smd endpoint
URL to be dynamic to generate the target URL
properly.
The change will make it work in master branch
but is still compatible with older TYPO3 versions.
Resolves: #56465
[TASK] Integrate PHP-Parser
Use PHP-Parser based on tokenizer.
Single line comments are now restricted to appear before

styles.
In general the handling of whitespaces and comments is sometimes
difficult; I adapted the printer to keep linebreaks in array
definitions and in method parameters
Resolves: #55686
